Slow Widgets
=================

### Instructions:

Create a technical improvement plan given limited information

### Scenario:

An application that you have just assumed complete responsibility for is used for finding locations that sell widgets near a given user. This application has an integration with an external system that lets users filter the results by their favorite widgets. User complaints have come in, saying the system:

* Is slow looking up nearby widgets
* Does not provide user feedback when importing favorite widgets

The metrics below are all that are currently captured for this application. Given that provided context, how would you approach planning technical improvement for this application?

### Appendix A

| Web Transactions | App server time      |
|------------------|----------------------|
| IntegrationController#update | 1235 ms  |
| IntegrationController#lookup | 1145 ms  |
| LocationController#find      | 645 ms   |
| HomeController#index         | 126.9 ms |
